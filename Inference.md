2. In the pop up, choose the relevant compute you want to use to deploy your API endpoint
3. You will be redirected to your endpoint
4. You can now use the `Try it Live` section with any text or link. 
5. You can now integrate your API with your code using the integration panel at the bottom of the page
6. You will now have a functioning API endpoint that returns the QnA pairs for input text!
