You can retrain the QnA model to enhance its' performance if you have an extensive dataset. You need to provide the training data in the SQUAD v1 format. This blueprint does training and deploys the fine tuned model which can be used for inference using API calls.

1. Click on `Use Blueprint` button
2. In the pop up, choose the relevant compute you want to use to deploy your API endpoint
3. You will be redirected to your endpoint
4. You can now use the `Try it Live` section with any text or link once the endpoint is deployed after training. 
5. You can now integrate your API with your code using the integration panel at the bottom of the page
6. You will now have a functioning API endpoint that returns Questions and answers for the input text.
